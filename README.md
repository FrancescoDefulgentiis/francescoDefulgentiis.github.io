I've become increasingly drawn to the **"build in public"** philosophy. This site is my way of stepping out of that comfort zone and into the wild.

Here, I document:
- **My thoughts** on software development and technology
- **My progress** on personal projects and professional growth
- **My learnings** from work, side projects, and curiosity-driven exploration

It's a space to clear out my mental backlog, track my evolution as an engineer, and hopefully connect with others who share similar interests. Every post is a snapshot of where I am, what I'm building, and what I'm learning.
