# Why Brutalism?

The modern web is often too polished. Too rounded. Too safe.

**Brutalism** (or at least this specific flavor of "Brutal Markdown") is about returning to the roots of information exchange.

## Key Principles

1. **Content First**: No heavy images or decorations distracting you.
2. **High Contrast**: Black on white. Hard lines.
3. **Honesty**: A link looks like a link `[Link]`. A button looks like a button `> Button`.
