As I briefly mentioned in my [first post](#/blog/hello-world), I feel like today’s internet has become an incredibly crowded place. Between aggressive advertisement spots, intrusive pop-ups, and over-engineered, flashy UIs, it all feels like a bit "much" for a personal blog.

I wanted to create a space that felt intentional. It's so easy to fall into the social media rabbit hole, scrolling endlessly through feeds of curated content. So, first things first: I sat down and chose a design philosophy that would help me stay true to my vision.

## The Manifesto
To keep myself honest as I build this site out, I have established a few immutable principles.

## Key Principles

1. **Signal Over Noise**: No heavy images or decorations distracting you (or me). If an element does not aid comprehension, it is deleted.
2. **Aggressive Legibility**: High contrast, clean typography, and a focus on the text.
3. **Syntactic Honesty**: A link looks like a link `[Link]`. A button looks like a button `> Button`. We stop hiding the machine.
4. **No Distractions**: No pop-ups, no ads, no unnecessary elements.
5. **User Sovereignty**: You are a guest, not a metric. No cookies, no trackers, no analytics. I do not need to know who you are to value that you are here.
6. **Low-Carbon Footprint**: By stripping away the bloat, this site consumes minimal energy to transfer and render. It is a tiny, quiet corner of a loud, energy-hungry network.
7. **Digital Vulnerability**: This is a diary, not a museum. I reserve the right to be wrong, to publish drafts, and to change my mind. The content here is a snapshot of who I was at the moment of writing, not a polished corporate statement.
8. **Wabi-Sabi**: Embracing the imperfect. If a layout breaks slightly on a specific screen size, or if a thought is incomplete, so be it. We prioritize the soul of the message over the polish of the pixel.

> 'Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.'

My life may be a mess, but my UI is clean.
